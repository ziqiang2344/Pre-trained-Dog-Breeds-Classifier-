Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: CNN model architecture VGG and ResNet both classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as labrador retriever. AlexNet classified the image as chihuahua instead.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classify Cat_01.jpg and Scissors_01.jpg to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: In my opinion, ResNet CNN model architecture did the best at classifying the four uploaded images because it takes lesser time to classify the image compared to VGG although they both classified the dog breed as labrador retriever correctly. Moreover, AlexNet did not classify the dog breed correctly as it classified the dog as chihuahua.
